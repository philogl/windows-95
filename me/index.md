# About Me

Howdy! My name is Ramisa. I am an Information Technology graduate from Townsville, in sunny North Queensland. Since 2019, however, I have found a new home in Sydney - quite the change from the laidback tropics.

When I am not working, you might find me reading at the beach, playing games at my PC with friends, practicing music, or going out on adventures with my friends.

I am also a huge cyber security enthusiast. I love to listen to podcasts, and read about security, in my spare time too! Currently, I am working on a choose-your-own-adventure text game about social engineering.
Some of my fave tech poddies would be:
- Smashing Security
- Hackable
- Reply All
- The Privacy, Security & OSINT Show
- KB Kast,
in addition to so many others.

I also listen to a bunch of non-security related podcasts, mostly comedy (faves would be anything by the McElroy brothers, Aunty Donna, and God is Dead)!

## And what about working with me?

Ah yes, if you are here to see what I have worked on, check out my resume.
